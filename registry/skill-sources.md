gh search repos --topic="llm-agent" --sort=stars --limit=20

## How to add a new source

When `gaia-curate` discovers a new marketplace, registry, or skill collection repo not already listed:

1. Add a row to the appropriate table above.
2. Include the URL, type, and a one-line search instruction.
3. Commit the change in the same PR as the skill additions that led to its discovery.

_Never remove a source; mark it stale with a `<!-- stale: <reason> -->` comment if it goes offline._
