description: Moves GitHub issues through a two-category (bug/enhancement) × five-state (needs-triage/needs-info/ready-for-agent/ready-for-human/wontfix) state machine. Reproduces bugs from issue steps, runs a domain-aware grilling session when needed, writes structured agent briefs, and appends AI-generated triage notes with the required disclaimer.

## Overview

Triage implements a deterministic triage state machine on top of a project issue tracker. The agent reads all existing triage notes to avoid re-asking resolved questions, attempts bug reproduction via code tracing and test execution before any grilling, and applies exactly one category role and one state role per issue.

For `ready-for-agent` issues the skill produces a structured agent brief. For `wontfix` enhancements it writes a `.out-of-scope/*.md` knowledge-base entry and links to it before closing. All comments must start with the AI-generation disclaimer. The maintainer can invoke quick state overrides bypassing grilling.
