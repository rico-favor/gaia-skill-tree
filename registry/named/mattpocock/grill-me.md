## Overview

Grill Me is the lightweight, documentation-free variant of the design-grilling pattern. It does not require a CONTEXT.md or ADR infrastructure. The agent interviews the user about every aspect of their plan, resolving decision-tree branches one dependency at a time. Each question comes paired with the agent's recommended answer to keep the conversation actionable.

Where a question can be answered by reading the codebase directly, the agent explores the codebase instead of asking. This substitution prevents unnecessary back-and-forth on empirically determinable facts.

## Origin

Second named implementation of the `design-review` skill bucket (origin: mattpocock/grill-with-docs). Grill Me is the simpler variant — no domain-model integration or documentation side effects.
