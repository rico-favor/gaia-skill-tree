## Overview

Edit Article models an article as a directed acyclic graph of information dependencies: each section can only introduce concepts that prior sections have established. Before rewriting anything, the agent divides the article into dependency-ordered sections and confirms the structure with the author. It then rewrites section by section, enforcing a 240-character maximum per paragraph to keep prose dense and scannable.

## Origin

Published by @mattpocock (Matt Pocock, Total TypeScript). Named implementation of the `document-editing` skill bucket for long-form article editing (origin: anthropic/pptx).
