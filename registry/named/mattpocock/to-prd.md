description: Synthesises the current conversation context and codebase knowledge into a fully-structured PRD — problem statement, extensive numbered user stories, implementation decisions (modules, interfaces, schema), testing decisions, and out-of-scope items — then publishes it to the project issue tracker.

## Overview

To PRD does not interview the user — it synthesises what it already knows from the conversation and codebase. The agent reads the domain glossary and existing ADRs, sketches major modules with deep-module opportunities (small interface, deep implementation), confirms module scope with the user, then writes the PRD using a strict template: problem statement → solution → extensive user stories → implementation decisions → testing decisions → out-of-scope → further notes.

The output is published directly to the issue tracker with the `needs-triage` label. Specific file paths and code snippets are intentionally excluded from implementation decisions to prevent fast-rotting documentation.

## Origin

First published by @mattpocock (Matt Pocock, Total TypeScript). This is the origin implementation for the `prd-generation` skill bucket.
