description: Drives a rigorous five-phase debugging discipline — build a feedback loop, minimise, hypothesise, instrument, fix and regression-test — refusing to proceed until a fast deterministic pass/fail signal exists. Applies to hard bugs and performance regressions.

## Overview

Diagnose by Matt Pocock enforces a disciplined debugging workflow structured as five explicit phases: (1) build a feedback loop, (2) minimise the reproduction, (3) generate and rank hypotheses, (4) instrument and test, (5) fix and write a regression test. The defining insight is Phase 1 — the agent spends disproportionate effort constructing a fast, deterministic, agent-runnable pass/fail signal before any other work. Without that signal, no amount of code inspection converges.

The skill covers a wide range of reproduction strategies: failing unit tests, curl/HTTP scripts against a running dev server, CLI invocations diffed against known-good snapshots, headless browser scripts, replay of captured traces, throwaway harnesses, and property/fuzz loops. Phases after Phase 1 are mechanical once the signal exists.
