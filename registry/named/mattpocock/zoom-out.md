description: Signals the agent to ascend one layer of abstraction and produce a map of all relevant modules, callers, and domain-glossary terms in the unfamiliar code area, without explaining implementation details.

## Overview

Zoom Out is a lightweight orientation directive: when the agent is unfamiliar with a section of code it triggers a single upward shift in abstraction level. Rather than explaining individual lines, the agent produces a module-and-caller map using the project's domain glossary vocabulary — giving the human (or an orchestrating agent) a navigational overview before drilling down.

The skill is intentionally minimal (`disable-model-invocation: true` in its source) and functions as a meta-signal to reframe from implementation to architecture.

## Origin

First published by @mattpocock (Matt Pocock, Total TypeScript). This is the origin implementation for the `code-explain` skill bucket's orientation/abstraction-lifting use case.
