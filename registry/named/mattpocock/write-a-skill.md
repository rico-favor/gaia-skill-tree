## Overview

Write a Skill is a meta-agent skill that walks the author through a structured interview (task domain, use cases, need for scripts, reference materials) before generating a SKILL.md. The output follows progressive-disclosure principles: the description field is crafted as the sole trigger signal visible to the agent at selection time (max 1024 chars, "use when…" pattern), and the body is split across SKILL.md, REFERENCE.md, and EXAMPLES.md when content exceeds 100 lines.

The skill also codifies the decision rules for when to bundle scripts (deterministic operations that would otherwise be regenerated each turn) and when to split files (distinct domains, rarely-needed advanced features).

## Origin

Second named implementation of the `tool-creation` skill bucket (origin: anthropic/skill-creator). Matt Pocock's version emphasises progressive disclosure, the trigger-description contract, and the scripts-vs-instructions decision rubric.
