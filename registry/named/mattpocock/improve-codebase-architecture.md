description: Identifies architectural deepening opportunities in a codebase — shallow modules with high interface-to-implementation ratios — using domain-glossary vocabulary and the deletion test, then grills the developer on the chosen candidate to design a deep-module replacement with better locality and testability.

## Overview

Improve Codebase Architecture applies a specific vocabulary of architectural leverage: modules, interfaces, implementations, depth, seams, adapters, and the deletion test. The agent explores the codebase organically looking for shallow modules (interface nearly as complex as the implementation), tightly-coupled modules leaking across seams, and pure functions extracted for testability but hiding the real bugs in their call sites.

Candidate opportunities are presented as a numbered list with files, problem, solution, and benefits framed in terms of locality and leverage. The agent then drops into a grilling loop on the chosen candidate, updating CONTEXT.md as new terms crystallise and offering ADRs only when rejections contain load-bearing reasons a future reviewer would need.
