## Overview

REST API README Generator by Spring AI Alibaba specializes in Java Spring Boot projects. The agent uses AST analysis to locate `@RestController`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, and related annotations, extracts endpoint paths, HTTP methods, request/response types, and generates a formatted README with a complete API reference table.

## Notes

This is a specialization of the `write-report` skill focused on Java Spring REST API documentation. The origin implementation for this bucket is `glincker/readme-generator` (general-purpose README generation).
