## Overview

Performance Analysis provides systematic profiling of Ruflo agents and system components to identify bottlenecks and guide optimization efforts. It instruments CPU, memory, and I/O subsystems to produce ranked hotspot reports, pairs measurements with concrete optimization recommendations, and supports both micro-benchmark experiments and full end-to-end workflow profiling.

## Key Capabilities

- **CPU/memory/I/O profiling**: instrumented measurement across all major resource dimensions
- **Hotspot ranking**: identifies and ranks the top bottlenecks by impact on overall performance
- **Optimization recommendations**: actionable advice paired with each identified hotspot
- **Micro-benchmarking**: isolated timing experiments for evaluating optimization hypotheses
- **End-to-end workflow profiling**: full-stack performance measurement across complete agent runs

## Origin

First published by @ruvnet as part of the Ruflo orchestration platform. This is the origin implementation for the `performance-tuning` skill bucket.

Sourced from the Ruflo platform (ruvnet/ruflo, 34k+ stars).
