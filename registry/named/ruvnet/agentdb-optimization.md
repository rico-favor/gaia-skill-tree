## Overview

AgentDB Optimization covers production-grade performance tuning for vector databases used by AI agents. This includes HNSW index tuning for 150x–12,500x faster search versus brute force, database sharding for horizontal scaling, connection pooling via singleton patterns, and comprehensive error handling for dimension mismatches and database locks.

## Key Capabilities

- **HNSW index tuning**: 150x–12,500x faster search performance compared to brute force
- **Database sharding**: horizontal scaling strategies for large vector stores
- **Connection pooling**: singleton patterns for efficient connection reuse
- **Production error handling**: dimension mismatch recovery and database lock resolution

## Origin

First published by @ruvnet as part of the Ruflo orchestration platform. This is the origin implementation for the `vector-db-optimization` skill bucket.
