## Overview

V3 Core Implementation establishes the foundational architecture for the Ruflo v3 platform. It covers the plugin discovery and registration system, server lifecycle management (startup/shutdown/hot-reload), API contract definitions for inter-plugin communication, and the event bus for decoupled component interactions.

## Key Capabilities

- **Plugin discovery and registration**: automatic detection and loading of installed plugins at startup
- **Server lifecycle management**: startup, graceful shutdown, and hot-reload without process restart
- **API contract definitions**: typed interface specifications governing inter-plugin communication
- **Event bus integration**: decoupled async communication across platform components

## Origin

First published by @ruvnet as part of the Ruflo orchestration platform. This is the origin implementation for the `core-platform-implementation` skill bucket.

Sourced from the Ruflo platform (ruvnet/ruflo, 34k+ stars).
