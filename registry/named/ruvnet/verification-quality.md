## Overview

Verification Quality enforces structured quality gates at task completion boundaries within Ruflo agent workflows. Rather than allowing agents to finalize tasks without review, it injects pre-completion checklist evaluation, automated test coverage verification, and documentation completeness checks. Only tasks that pass all configured gates are allowed to proceed to final output.

## Key Capabilities

- **Pre-completion checklists**: configurable verification steps that must pass before task finalization
- **Automated quality gates**: programmatic enforcement of quality standards at completion boundaries
- **Test coverage verification**: ensures specified coverage thresholds are met before sign-off
- **Documentation checks**: validates that required documentation is present and complete

## Origin

Published by @ruvnet as a variant implementation for the `verification-before-completion` skill bucket.
