## Overview

V3 MCP Optimization improves the MCP server performance in the Ruflo v3 platform. It implements connection pooling for reduced handshake overhead, request batching for throughput improvements, tool schema caching to eliminate repeated introspection, and response streaming for large outputs. The result is measurably lower latency for agent-to-MCP interactions.

## Key Capabilities

- **Connection pooling**: reuse of established connections to reduce per-request handshake overhead
- **Request batching**: grouping of concurrent requests for improved throughput
- **Tool schema caching**: elimination of redundant introspection calls via in-memory schema cache
- **Response streaming**: chunked delivery of large tool outputs for reduced time-to-first-byte

## Origin

Published by @ruvnet as a variant implementation for the `mcp-integration` skill bucket.

Sourced from the Ruflo platform (ruvnet/ruflo, 34k+ stars).
