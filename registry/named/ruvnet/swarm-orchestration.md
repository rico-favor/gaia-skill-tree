## Overview

Swarm Orchestration provides foundational swarm network topology management for multi-agent systems. It supports four topology patterns: hierarchical for centralized coordination, mesh for peer-to-peer equality, ring for sequential processing, and star for delegation. The system handles load balancing through performance-based agent selection and provides built-in fault tolerance with retry logic and task reassignment.

## Key Capabilities

- **4 topology patterns**: hierarchical, mesh, ring, and star agent network configurations
- **Load balancing**: performance-based agent selection and dynamic work distribution
- **Fault tolerance**: retry logic and automatic task reassignment on agent failure
- **Shared memory coordination**: cross-agent context sharing for coherent swarm behavior
- **Real-time performance monitoring**: live agent health and throughput metrics

## Origin

First published by @ruvnet as part of the Ruflo orchestration platform. This is the origin implementation for the `swarm-topology-management` skill bucket.

Sourced from the Ruflo platform (ruvnet/ruflo, 34k+ stars).
