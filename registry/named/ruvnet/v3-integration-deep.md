## Overview

V3 Integration Deep focuses on connecting all Ruflo v3 subsystems into a coherent whole. It establishes integration contracts between components, implements the event bus for async cross-component communication, builds compatibility layers for legacy plugin support, and validates end-to-end workflows across subsystem boundaries.

## Key Capabilities

- **Integration contract design**: typed contracts governing interactions between all v3 subsystems
- **Event bus implementation**: async cross-component communication without direct dependencies
- **Legacy compatibility layers**: bridge adapters enabling older plugins to operate in the v3 runtime
- **Cross-component workflow validation**: end-to-end test coverage across subsystem boundaries

## Origin

First published by @ruvnet as part of the Ruflo orchestration platform. This is the origin implementation for the `system-integration` skill bucket.

Sourced from the Ruflo platform (ruvnet/ruflo, 34k+ stars).
