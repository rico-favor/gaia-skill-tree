## Overview

Worker Integration implements the core dispatch layer for Ruflo's background worker system. It maps incoming trigger events to curated agent combinations, routes tasks to the most suitable workers based on confidence scoring, and closes the feedback loop by recording performance data for continuous improvement. The system supports 8 distinct trigger types and adapts agent selection over time.

## Key Capabilities

- **8-trigger dispatch mapping**: routes code review, testing, documentation, security, performance, refactoring, deployment, and maintenance triggers to appropriate agent sets
- **Confidence-scored agent selection**: ranks available agents by historical performance and task affinity before dispatch
- **Performance feedback loop**: records task outcomes back into the dispatch model for adaptive routing improvement
- **Structured memory patterns**: stores task results and agent performance metrics in the Ruflo memory subsystem for cross-session learning

## Origin

First published by @ruvnet as part of the Ruflo orchestration platform. This is the origin implementation for the `worker-agent-dispatch` skill bucket.

Sourced from the Ruflo platform (ruvnet/ruflo, 34k+ stars).
