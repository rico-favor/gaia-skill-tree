## Overview

Dual Collect is the harvest phase of the Claude+Codex dual-mode orchestration pattern. After headless Codex workers complete their tasks, Dual Collect queries the shared memory namespace to retrieve, filter, and aggregate their outputs. It reports on worker completion status and health, and surfaces results in summary, detailed, or raw JSON format for downstream consumption by the Claude session.

## Key Capabilities

- **Namespace-based result querying**: retrieves all worker outputs from the designated shared memory namespace with optional key filtering
- **Multi-format output**: supports summary, detailed, and raw JSON output modes for different consumption contexts
- **Worker health reporting**: provides completion status, error counts, and overall health score for each spawned worker
- **Completion tracking**: distinguishes between completed, running, and failed workers to guide collection timing decisions

## Origin

First published by @ruvnet as part of the Ruflo orchestration platform. This is the origin implementation for the `headless-worker-collect` skill bucket.
