## Overview

Hooks Automation gives Ruflo agents a rich event-driven automation layer. Lifecycle hooks intercept pre- and post-task boundaries for quality gates, logging, and side-effect management. Timer-based background workers run scheduled tasks independently of the main agent loop. Twelve built-in worker templates cover common automation patterns out of the box.

## Key Capabilities

- **Lifecycle hooks (pre/post task)**: intercept task start and completion for quality gates and logging
- **Timer-based workers**: schedule recurring background tasks at configurable intervals
- **12 built-in background workers**: ready-made templates for common automation patterns
- **Event-driven quality gates**: block task completion when quality checks fail
- **Workflow scheduling**: coordinate multi-step workflows across agent lifecycles

## Origin

Published by @ruvnet as a variant implementation for the `workflow-automation` skill bucket.

Sourced from the Ruflo platform (ruvnet/ruflo, 34k+ stars).
