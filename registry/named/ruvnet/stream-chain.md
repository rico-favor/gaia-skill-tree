## Overview

Stream Chain orchestrates agents in a sequential pipeline where each agent's output becomes the next agent's input context. This enables complex multi-stage data transformation workflows where information is progressively refined, enriched, or transformed through a series of specialist agents. Configurable timeouts and both custom and predefined pipeline templates give flexibility across use cases.

## Key Capabilities

- **Sequential context chaining**: each pipeline stage receives the full output of the preceding stage
- **Custom and predefined pipelines**: use built-in templates or define fully custom agent sequences
- **Configurable timeouts**: per-stage and global timeout controls for long-running transformations
- **Swarm and memory integration**: pipelines can fan out to swarms or persist state to Ruflo memory

## Origin

First published by @ruvnet as part of the Ruflo orchestration platform. This is the origin implementation for the `sequential-agent-pipeline` skill bucket.

Sourced from the Ruflo platform (ruvnet/ruflo, 34k+ stars).
