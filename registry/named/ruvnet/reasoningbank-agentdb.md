## Overview

ReasoningBank AgentDB bridges the reasoning pattern bank with AgentDB vector storage. It serializes agent decision trajectories into vector-searchable formats, enabling future sessions to retrieve relevant past reasoning patterns via semantic similarity. This creates a persistent institutional memory that improves decision quality over time.

## Key Capabilities

- **Reasoning pattern serialization**: conversion of decision trajectories into vector-searchable representations
- **Vector storage persistence**: AgentDB-backed durable storage for cross-session memory
- **Semantic pattern retrieval**: similarity-based lookup of relevant past reasoning chains
- **Trajectory analysis**: decomposition and indexing of multi-step agent decision paths

## Origin

First published by @ruvnet as part of the Ruflo orchestration platform. This is the origin implementation for the `learned-memory-integration` skill bucket.
