## Overview

V3 Security Overhaul applies a comprehensive security audit and remediation pass to the entire Ruflo v3 platform. It establishes zero-trust federation across all subsystem boundaries, implements mutual TLS with ed25519 key authentication, deploys 14-type PII detection for data privacy compliance, and runs automated CVE scanning against the full dependency tree.

## Key Capabilities

- **Zero-trust federation**: per-request verification across all Ruflo v3 subsystem boundaries
- **mTLS + ed25519 auth**: mutual TLS authentication with ed25519 key pairs for agent identity
- **14-type PII detection**: automated identification and redaction of sensitive data in agent outputs
- **Behavioral trust scoring**: dynamic trust levels based on agent activity patterns and anomaly detection
- **CVE scanning**: automated vulnerability scanning of the full v3 dependency tree

## Origin

Published by @ruvnet as a variant implementation for the `security-audit` skill bucket.

Sourced from the Ruflo platform (ruvnet/ruflo, 34k+ stars).
