## Overview

AgentDB Vector Search provides the core similarity search capability for agent memory retrieval. It supports multiple distance metrics: cosine similarity for semantic tasks, Euclidean/L2 for spatial data, dot product for normalized vectors, and fully customizable metric implementations. HNSW indexing enables sub-linear search complexity across millions of vectors.

## Key Capabilities

- **Multi-metric search**: cosine, Euclidean, dot-product, and custom distance metrics
- **HNSW indexing**: hierarchical navigable small-world graph for sub-linear search complexity
- **Sub-linear search complexity**: efficient querying across millions of high-dimensional vectors
- **Semantic query matching**: natural language to embedding-space similarity retrieval

## Origin

First published by @ruvnet as part of the Ruflo orchestration platform. This is the origin implementation for the `vector-search` skill bucket.
