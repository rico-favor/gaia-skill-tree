## Overview

V3 CLI Modernization is the command-line interface overhaul component of the Ruflo v3 sprint. It covers redesigning the CLI for better discoverability, implementing plugin architecture for extensible command sets, adopting modern conventions (subcommand grouping, context-aware help, shell completion), and ensuring backward compatibility during migration.

## Key Capabilities

- **CLI UX redesign**: improved discoverability through subcommand grouping and context-aware help
- **Plugin architecture**: extensible command sets via a first-class plugin registration system
- **Shell completion**: tab-completion support across bash, zsh, and fish shells
- **Backward compatibility**: migration path preserving existing scripts and workflows
