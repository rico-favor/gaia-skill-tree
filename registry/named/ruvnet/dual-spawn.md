## Overview

Dual Spawn is the launch phase of the Claude+Codex dual-mode orchestration pattern. It enables Claude Code to spin up headless Codex workers in the background without blocking interactive reasoning. Workers are configured with type, count, and shared memory namespace before being dispatched, allowing a Claude session to delegate parallelizable subtasks to multiple Codex instances simultaneously.

## Key Capabilities

- **Headless Codex worker launch**: spawns one or more Codex worker processes detached from the interactive Claude session
- **Configurable types/counts**: supports multiple worker types (research, implementation, review, test) with variable concurrency
- **Shared memory coordination**: establishes a named memory namespace accessible to both Claude and all spawned Codex workers
- **Parallel background execution**: enables simultaneous multi-task processing without blocking Claude's interactive reasoning loop

## Origin

First published by @ruvnet as part of the Ruflo orchestration platform. This is the origin implementation for the `headless-worker-spawn` skill bucket.

Sourced from the Ruflo platform (ruvnet/ruflo, 34k+ stars).
