## Overview

V3 Performance Optimization covers end-to-end performance improvement for the Ruflo v3 platform. It profiles startup time, request handling latency, memory footprint, and concurrent throughput. Targeted optimizations include lazy module loading for startup time, request path hot-pathing, memory pool reuse, and parallel initialization of independent subsystems.

## Key Capabilities

- **Startup time profiling**: identification and elimination of slow module load paths
- **Latency hotspot identification**: request-path instrumentation pinpointing high-latency operations
- **Memory footprint reduction**: pool reuse strategies and leak detection for production deployments
- **Parallel initialization**: concurrent startup of independent subsystems for faster boot times

## Origin

Published by @ruvnet as a variant implementation for the `performance-tuning` skill bucket.

Sourced from the Ruflo platform (ruvnet/ruflo, 34k+ stars).
