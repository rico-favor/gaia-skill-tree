## Overview

Worker Benchmarks provides a multi-dimensional performance evaluation framework for Ruflo background workers. It measures latency, throughput, memory usage, and quality scores simultaneously, checks results against defined compliance thresholds, tracks results over time to detect regressions, and produces comparative reports across worker configurations.

## Key Capabilities

- **Multi-dimensional benchmarking**: simultaneous measurement of latency, throughput, memory, and quality
- **Compliance threshold checking**: validates that workers meet defined performance SLAs
- **Historical regression tracking**: compares benchmark results across runs to surface regressions
- **Worker comparison reports**: side-by-side performance comparison across worker implementations

## Origin

Published by @ruvnet as a variant implementation for the `skill-performance-benchmarking` skill bucket.

Sourced from the Ruflo platform (ruvnet/ruflo, 34k+ stars).
