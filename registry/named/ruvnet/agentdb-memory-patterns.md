## Overview

AgentDB Memory Patterns provides structured approaches to agent memory organization. It covers eight memory types: knowledge, context, task data, results, errors, metrics, consensus records, and system configuration. LRU caching ensures fast access to frequently used patterns. SQLite persistence enables cross-session continuity with WAL mode for concurrent access.

## Key Capabilities

- **8 memory type taxonomy**: knowledge, context, task data, results, errors, metrics, consensus records, and system config
- **LRU caching**: fast retrieval for frequently accessed memory patterns
- **SQLite WAL persistence**: cross-session continuity with concurrent-access write-ahead logging
- **Associative memory building**: structured links between related memory entries for contextual retrieval
