## Overview

V3 DDD Architecture applies Domain-Driven Design methodology to the Ruflo v3 codebase restructuring. It establishes bounded contexts for the core orchestration, memory, plugin, and agent domains. Aggregate roots encapsulate domain logic, domain events enable decoupled cross-context communication, and ubiquitous language ensures consistent terminology across code, docs, and team communication.

## Key Capabilities

- **Bounded context definition**: explicit separation of orchestration, memory, plugin, and agent domains
- **Aggregate root design**: domain logic encapsulation with clear ownership boundaries
- **Domain event modeling**: decoupled cross-context communication via typed domain events
- **Ubiquitous language establishment**: consistent terminology across code, documentation, and team communication

## Origin

Published by @ruvnet as a variant implementation for the `ubiquitous-language` skill bucket.

Sourced from the Ruflo platform (ruvnet/ruflo, 34k+ stars).
