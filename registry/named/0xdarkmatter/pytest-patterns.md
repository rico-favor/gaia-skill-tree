## Overview

Pytest Patterns is a security-audited skill published in the AI Skill Store marketplace. It codifies modern pytest best practices for Python 3.9+ projects targeting pytest 7.0+. The skill covers the full testing lifecycle: test structure and naming, fixture design (simple, factory, and parametrised fixtures), `pytest.mark` strategies, async testing with `pytest-asyncio`, mocking with `pytest-mock`, coverage analysis, and integration test patterns.

## Key Patterns

- **Fixtures**: simple, factory, parametrised, session-scoped, and `conftest.py` layout
- **Parametrize**: data-driven tests with `@pytest.mark.parametrize`
- **Async**: `pytest-asyncio` for testing coroutines and async context managers
- **Mocking**: `pytest-mock` MagicMock, patch decorators, and spy usage
- **Coverage**: `pytest-cov` configuration, branch coverage, and reporting
- **Integration**: database fixtures, HTTP client stubs, and test isolation strategies

## Compatibility

`pytest 7.0+`, `Python 3.9+`. Optional: `pytest-asyncio`, `pytest-mock`, `pytest-cov`.
