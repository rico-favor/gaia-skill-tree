description: Portable CLI tool that connects to MCP servers on-demand, enumerates available tools, displays them, and executes calls — works with any MCP-compatible backend without platform lock-in.

## Overview

A universal MCP client that treats server connections as ephemeral: connect, list tools, call, disconnect. Designed for use inside agent loops where the set of available MCP servers may change between turns.

## Key behaviours

- Enumerates all tools exposed by a target MCP server at connection time
- Executes tool calls with structured arguments and returns typed responses
- Handles multi-server routing — each call specifies the server by name or URL
- Authentication is handled via environment variables; no credentials in prompts
