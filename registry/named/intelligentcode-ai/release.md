description: Automates the full release cycle — semantic version bump, CHANGELOG update, PR merge, git tag, and GitHub release creation with multiple verification gates.
tags: [release, semver, changelog, git-tag, github-release, automation]

## Overview

Drives a release from a merged feature branch to a published GitHub release. Determines the correct semantic version from commit messages (conventional commits), updates CHANGELOG.md, creates and pushes the tag, and publishes a release with auto-generated notes.

## Key behaviours

- Conventional commits parser to determine major/minor/patch bump
- CHANGELOG.md update following Keep-a-Changelog format
- Git tag creation with signed commits where configured
- GitHub Release API call with release notes derived from commit log
