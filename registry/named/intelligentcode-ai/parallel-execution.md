description: Manages concurrent work item execution with independence verification, queue-based state tracking, and configurable concurrency limits (default 5).

## Overview

Before launching parallel tasks, verifies that each candidate is truly independent (no shared mutable state, no ordering constraints). Tracks running items in a queue and merges results once all branches complete.

## Key behaviours

- Independence check before fan-out: aborts if tasks share a dependency
- Configurable concurrency ceiling (default 5 simultaneous items)
- Queue-based tracking with per-item status (pending / running / done / failed)
- Fan-in: waits for all branches, merges outputs, surfaces failures individually
