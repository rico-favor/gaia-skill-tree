description: Forces the AI agent to follow a strict red-green-refactor TDD workflow — writing failing tests before any implementation code, blocking code generation that skips the test step, and enforcing coverage thresholds before completing a task.

## Overview

TDD by Addy Osmani is a workflow-enforcement skill that constrains the agent to the classic red-green-refactor cycle. Before writing any implementation, the agent must write a failing test that specifies the desired behavior. It is blocked from proceeding until the test exists and fails for the right reason — preventing the common failure mode where agents write code first and retrofit tests after.
