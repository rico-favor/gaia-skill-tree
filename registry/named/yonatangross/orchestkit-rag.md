## Overview

OrchestrKit RAG is a comprehensive RAG retrieval skill drawn from the OrchestrKit AI development toolkit. It ships with 30+ rule files spanning every stage of the retrieval pipeline: embedding model selection, chunking strategies, pgvector schema design, hybrid BM25+dense search, HyDE query expansion, cross-encoder and LLM-based reranking, multimodal embeddings, and agentic patterns like self-RAG, corrective-RAG, and adaptive retrieval.

## Key Patterns

- **Core**: basic RAG, context management, hybrid search, pipeline composition
- **HyDE**: per-concept generation, fallback chains, HyDE+query combo
- **pgvector**: schema, indexing, hybrid search, metadata filtering
- **Reranking**: cross-encoder, LLM judge, combined ensemble
- **Agentic**: self-RAG, corrective-RAG, adaptive retrieval, knowledge graph
- **Multimodal**: chunking, embeddings, multimodal pipeline

## Origin

First published by @yonatangross as part of the OrchestrKit Claude Code toolkit (103 skills). This is the origin implementation for the `rag-pipeline` skill bucket.

Sourced from the SkillsMP marketplace entry for `rag-retrieval` (orchestkit, 160 stars).
