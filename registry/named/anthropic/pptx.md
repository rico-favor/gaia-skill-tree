## Overview

PPTX Editor by Anthropic uses the `markitdown` library to extract text and layout from `.pptx` files into a structured intermediate representation. The agent can then edit content, reorder slides, apply design rules, or generate new slides programmatically — then pack the result back into a valid `.pptx` file.

## Origin
