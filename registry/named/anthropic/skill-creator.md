## Overview

Skill Creator is a meta-agent skill that turns the agent into an interactive skill author. It conducts a structured interview with the user — asking about the skill's name, trigger phrase, inputs, and expected outputs — then generates a fully-formed `SKILL.md` file. The output is immediately installable in any Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex CLI skills directory.

## Origin

First published by @anthropic. This is the origin implementation for the `tool-creation` skill bucket under the agent-skill-authoring use case.
