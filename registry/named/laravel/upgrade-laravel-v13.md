## Overview

This named skill implements the `framework-upgrade` generic skill for the Laravel 12 → 13 migration path. The agent follows a structured checklist: audits breaking changes in the Laravel 13 changelog, updates `composer.json` dependencies, migrates config files, runs `php artisan migrate`, and executes the full test suite before marking the upgrade complete.

## Origin

First published by the @laravel team. This is the origin implementation for the `framework-upgrade` skill bucket.
