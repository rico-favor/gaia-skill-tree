## Overview

Unittest Generator is a Claude Code agent shipped with the Upsonic autonomous agent framework. Given a source module (e.g. `auth.py`), it analyses the code, identifies functions and classes, generates a complete `unittest.TestCase` suite, and writes it into a concept-organised `tests/` folder structure. It handles imports, mocking, and edge-case scenarios automatically.

## Key Capabilities

- **TestCase generation**: produces `unittest.TestCase` classes with `setUp`, `tearDown`, and individual test methods
- **Concept-based layout**: groups tests into subfolders that mirror the conceptual structure of the source
- **Edge-case coverage**: identifies boundary conditions and error paths from the source code
- **Autonomous**: runs without per-file prompting once triggered

## Origin

First published by @Upsonic as a prebuilt Claude Code agent. This is the origin implementation for the `generate-test` skill bucket.

Sourced from the SkillsMP marketplace entry for `summarization`/`unittest-generator` (Upsonic/Upsonic, 7 836 stars).
