description: >
  Classifies the affective polarity (positive / negative / neutral, or fine-grained)
  of user-generated text. Covers the full pipeline from raw noisy input through
  preprocessing, inference, and output normalisation. Stack is intentionally
  tool-agnostic — three implementation tracks are documented below.
---

## Implementation

### Pipeline stages

1. **Ingestion & normalisation** — strip HTML/markup, decode emojis to text tokens or
   drop them per domain policy, lower-case, collapse repeated punctuation.
2. **Language detection** — route multilingual corpora to language-specific models or
   a multilingual backbone; flag low-confidence detections for human review.
3. **Inference** — see stack options below.
4. **Confidence filtering** — discard or escalate predictions below a calibrated
   threshold (typically 0.65–0.75 probability); do not force a label on ambiguous text.
5. **Output normalisation** — map raw scores to a stable schema
   (`{label, score, model_version, input_len}`); store model version alongside each
   prediction to enable reproducible re-scoring after model updates.

### Stack options

#### Track A — Transformer-based (recommended for accuracy)

Use `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest` or `nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment` (5-class) as backbone, or a domain-fine-tuned checkpoint. Serve via HuggingFace `pipeline("text-classification")` for batch jobs, vLLM or TGI for latency-sensitive APIs. For inputs > 512 tokens, split into overlapping windows and aggregate by majority vote or mean-pooled logits — do not silently truncate. Highest accuracy on informal and ironic text; GPU preferred; inference cost scales with throughput.

#### Track B — Lexicon-based (interpretable, zero-shot)

VADER covers English social media out of the box with negation handling and intensifier boosting; alternatives include SentiWordNet, AFINN, or domain-specific word lists. No training data required, CPU-only, fast — but degrades on domain-specific jargon and sarcasm. Compound score threshold needs tuning per corpus.

#### Track C — Instruction-tuned LLM (flexible, slower)

Prompt a chat-capable model with a structured classification prompt requesting JSON output with `label` and `rationale` fields. Best suited for low-volume pipelines, aspect-based SA, or cases where explanations are required alongside labels. Cache identical inputs and use batch APIs to control cost; fall back to Track A for high-volume paths.

### Aspect-based extension (optional)

For reviews requiring per-aspect scores (e.g. *price*, *delivery*, *quality*), extract aspect spans with an NER or dependency-parse step, run sentiment inference per span rather than over the full review, then aggregate to a per-aspect sentiment vector alongside an overall label.

---

### Evaluation

Benchmark on a held-out set that mirrors production distribution.
Standard metrics: **macro-F1** (primary), accuracy, and confusion matrix.
Report separately for each star-rating bucket or domain slice if data permits.
Minimum acceptable macro-F1 on SST-2 or equivalent: **0.88** for Track A,
**0.72** for Track B.
