## Reclassification Request

### Target Skill
- **ID:** `webScrape`
- **Current Level:** III → **Proposed Level:** IV
- **Current Rarity:** Uncommon → **Proposed Rarity:** Uncommon (no change)

### Justification
Since the initial Level III classification, multiple independent demonstrations have shown `webScrape` handling dynamic JavaScript-rendered pages, pagination, and anti-bot measures — failure modes that were previously undocumented. The skill now meets the Level IV bar: "Handles edge cases and failures."

### New Evidence
| Class | Source | Evaluator | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B | https://github.com/example/scraper-v2/blob/main/RESULTS.md | contributor1 | 2026-04-26 | Demonstrated scraping of 50 JS-rendered pages with Playwright, handling CAPTCHAs and rate limits. Logs archived. |
| B | https://github.com/example/scraper-benchmark/blob/main/benchmark.md | contributor2 | 2026-04-25 | Benchmarked across 10 anti-bot-protected sites. 92% success rate with documented failure analysis. |

### Checklist
