## The Tree

Every AI agent capability exists somewhere on this graph. Skills start at the foundation tier, awaken through evidence, evolve through use, and fuse into things greater than the sum of their parts.

The snapshot below shows two example upgrade paths from the full graph.

## What This Means for You

- **Track your agent's capabilities**: every skill your agent demonstrates gets logged to your personal skill tree, tied to your configured Gaia username, and portable across every repo you own.
- **Unlock combinations**: when your agent has the prerequisites, a new extra or ultimate skill becomes available to fuse. `gaia scan` detects recommendations and writes promotion candidates for you to review.
- **Name and share skills**: contribute named implementations of generic skills, such as `karpathy/autoresearch`, attributed to your identity and installable by anyone via `gaia skills install`. Pending intakes are overlaid in `gaia skills list/search/info` by default.
- **Contribute to the canon**: review draft skills, submit evidence, or create new skills from strong reviews. Curated registry changes live in `registry/`; draft intake lives in `registry-for-review/`.

## Tutorial

> [!TIP]
> **New here?** The interactive tutorial at **[gaia.tiongson.co](https://gaia.tiongson.co/)** covers everything visually: skill tiers, the rank system, the full get-started workflow, and copy-paste commands.

---

## The Hierarchy

| Tier | Symbol | Display Name | What it means |
|---|---|---|---|
| basic | ○ | **Basic Skill** | Primitive, indivisible capability: the genome of every agent |
| extra | ◇ | **Extra Skill** | Emerges from combining 2+ basic skills and transcends its parts |
| ultimate | ◆ | **Ultimate Skill** | High-complexity emergent capability with a strict evidence bar |

## Rank System: The Transcendent Line

Skills level up through evidence, not declaration:

| Level | Class | Rank | Evidence Floor | What it means |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0` | F | **Unawakened** | None | Universal LLM primitive: any capable model does this by default |
| `I` | D | **Awakened** | None | Foundation tier: catalogued agent capability |
| `II` | C | **Named** | Evidence Tier C | First confirmed demonstration |
| `III` | B | **Evolved** | Evidence Tier B | Reproducible and fully documented |
| `IV` | A | **Hardened** | Evidence Tier B or A | Failure modes known; battle-tested |
| `V` | S | **Transcendent** | Evidence Tier A | Composable and self-improving |
| `VI` | SS | **Transcendent ★** | Evidence Tier A | Apex: peer-reviewed, named to the agent who unlocked it |

## Install

<!-- gaia:version-start -->
Current Gaia CLI version: `2.2.11`.

Python install:

```bash
pip install gaia-cli
```

npm wrapper alternative:

```bash
npm install -g @gaia-registry/cli
```
<!-- gaia:version-end -->

For registry development, use an editable install from the repo root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbtiongson1/gaia-skill-tree.git
cd gaia-skill-tree
pip install -e .
```

## Quickstart

```bash
gaia init --user your-username
gaia pull
gaia scan
gaia appraise
gaia skills search web
```

`gaia scan` detects skills, writes `generated-output/promotion-candidates.json`, and renders your local tree to `generated-output/tree.html` and `generated-output/tree.md`.

Promotion is scan-gated. `gaia promote <skill>` uses the level recommended by the most recent `generated-output/promotion-candidates.json`, and the scan must be less than 24 hours old.

## Named Skills Browser

The registry ships an interactive Named Skills browser at [`docs/index.html`](docs/index.html):

- **Level-filtered tabs**: browse by Named (II), Evolved (III), Hardened (IV), or all levels.
- **Expandable cards**: each card shows the contributor, title, description, `genericSkillRef`, tags, and a direct link to the upstream `SKILL.md`.
- **Graph canvas**: node labels show `contributor/skill-name` for named implementations and `/slug` for anonymous skills by default. The **Named Skills** button dims all non-named nodes and highlights named implementations.

Serve locally with `python -m http.server 8080` from the repo root, then open `http://localhost:8080/docs/`.

`docs/graph/*` is a generated GitHub Pages mirror so the `docs/` site can run as a self-contained static site. The canonical files live in `registry/`.

## Real Skill Catalog

Gaia also keeps a curated catalog of real-world named `SKILL.md` entries before they are promoted into the canonical graph:

- Source data: [`registry/real-skills.json`](registry/real-skills.json)
- Generated HTML: [`registry/real-skills.html`](registry/real-skills.html)
- Generated Markdown: [`registry/real-skills.md`](registry/real-skills.md)

Use this catalog to bucket popular named skills from sources such as VoltAgent's Awesome Agent Skills, AgentSkills.me, official skill pages, and Superpowers. The canonical DAG lives in `registry/gaia.json`; the real skill catalog is a review surface for source-backed names and Gaia mappings.

```
<!-- gaia:cli-end -->

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `gaia init` | Creates `.gaia/config.toml`, asks for or accepts `--user`, and creates a stub user tree when run inside a registry clone. |
| `gaia scan` | Scans configured paths, writes `generated-output/promotion-candidates.json`, and renders `generated-output/tree.{html,md}`. |
| `gaia scan --auto-promote` | Runs scan, promotes every scan-approved candidate, and re-renders the tree. |
| `gaia pull` | Refreshes registry data from `origin`. |
| `gaia push` | Writes a batch intake record under `registry-for-review/skill-batches/` and opens a PR when possible. |
| `gaia appraise [skillId]` | Renders a skill card and shows what the last scan flagged as promotable. |
| `gaia promote <skill>` | Promotes only if the skill appeared in the last scan candidates; Gaia uses the scan-suggested level. |
| `gaia promote --all` | Promotes every valid candidate from the last scan. |
| `gaia tree` | Renders your personal tree to `generated-output/tree.html` and `generated-output/tree.md`. |
| `gaia graph` | Generates and opens `registry/render/gaia.html`; use `--format svg` for `registry/gaia.svg` or `--format json` for render JSON. |
| `gaia version`, `gaia --version`, `gaia -v` | Prints the CLI version. |
| `gaia mcp` | Runs the bundled MCP server from `packages/mcp`. |
| `gaia release {patch|minor|major}` | Maintainer release bump across Python, npm, MCP, and registry versions. |
| `gaia docs build` | Regenerates marker-owned docs sections and docs-site stats. |
| `gaia docs build --check` | Fails if generated docs have drifted. |
| `gaia skills list/search/info/install/uninstall` | Browses and manages named skills, overlaying your pending intake by default. |

### Typical Workflow

```bash
# In the project repo you want Gaia to scan
gaia init --user your-username

# Detect skills and render your tree
gaia scan
gaia appraise

# Promote only scan-approved candidates
gaia promote web-search

# Submit draft skill intake for maintainer review
gaia push --dry-run
gaia push
```

Intake PRs are draft review artifacts. Accepted candidates are promoted later into canonical `registry/gaia.json` updates.

## MCP Server (Agent-Native Integration)

`@gaia-registry/mcp-server` connects Gaia directly to MCP-compatible agents such as Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, and others:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gaia": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@gaia-registry/mcp-server"],
      "env": { "GAIA_USER": "your-github-username" }
    }
  }
}
```

Once connected, your agent gets these tools:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `gaia_lookup` | Search skills by ID or fuzzy name |
| `gaia_suggest` | Get fusion recommendations from your current context |
| `gaia_scan_context` | Detect skills from connected tools and project signals |
| `gaia_my_tree` | View your skill tree and stats |
| `gaia_propose` | Claim a fusion or propose a novel skill |

The MCP server also exposes resources at `gaia://registry` and `gaia://tree/{username}`.

See [`packages/mcp/`](packages/mcp/) for full documentation.

## Maintainer Hooks

Contributors who edit the canonical graph can install the repo-local hook once:

```bash
bash scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

The pre-commit hook checks version lockstep, applies a semantic bump from the commit message, regenerates registry artifacts, runs `gaia docs build`, and stages generated outputs.

## Contributing

Gaia is meant to be a shared map of agent capabilities, and there are a few good ways to help even if you are not ready to edit the graph directly.

You can contribute by **reviewing skill drafts**: read a proposed skill, check whether the definition is clear, compare it against existing skills, evaluate the cited evidence, and submit peer review analysis that helps maintainers decide whether the skill should be accepted, renamed, merged, or reclassified.

You can also contribute by **creating skills directly from reviews**: turn a well-supported review into a concrete Basic Skill, Extra Skill, Ultimate Skill, fusion recipe, or reclassification PR with evidence and rationale.

For full instructions, including evidence requirements, PR templates, naming rules, and reviewer criteria, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
